Hello everyone! Welcome to my new blog. 

I am Artem Sholokhov, an engineer who loves simple, fast and correct code, cutting-edge technology, science, 
books, music and video games. I'm a huge fan of functional programming, reactive distributed systems and micro 
services architecture, so I hope to dedicate some posts to these topics on my new blog.

Currently I work at [XITE](http://www.xite.nl/) as a Head of Development, where we build first in the world 
personalized music television service to create the best music videos experience for everyone. 
At XITE I responsible for the whole core backend platform, which is distributed in several cluster across the 
world. I'm working on system architecture, designing and developing main components, cloud infrastructure and 
many other exciting things!

Throughout my career I was writing and storing notes for myself about various aspects of software development and
I’ve decided that the time has come to organize all of them and make a one place to share it with everyone. 

I hope you will find something useful and interesting for you! 

I always open to good discussion so don’t hesitate to write me an email, message, or follow me on social 
networks.
